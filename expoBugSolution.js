Restarting the Expo development server is often the most effective solution. This can usually be done by closing the terminal window running the server and restarting it. If the problem persists, upgrading the Expo CLI to the latest version might resolve underlying bugs or incompatibilities.  If the problem still continues, checking for conflicting packages, particularly those involved in networking or data handling, might help isolate the issue.  In more severe cases, restarting the computer may be necessary to clear system resources.

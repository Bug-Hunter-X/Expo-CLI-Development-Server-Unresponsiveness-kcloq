While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly stop responding or become unresponsive. This would prevent any further code changes from being reflected in the app running on the simulator or physical device.  The error messages in the terminal were often vague or unhelpful, providing no clear indication of the cause.
